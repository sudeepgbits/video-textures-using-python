# video textures using python

In this project we applied our computational photography with the purpose of creating [video textures](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/cpl/projects/videotexture/) (infinitely looping pieces of video). These are basically gifs with very smooth transtitions,Video Textures. The process is also described in [Video Textures](http://cs.colby.edu/courses/F07/cs397/papers/schodl-videoTextures-sig00.pdf) (Scholdl, et al; SIGGRAPH 2000).

## Instructions to run the code:
	1) copy frames of a video in videos/source/*
	2) run main.py
	3) output will be stored in videos/out/
